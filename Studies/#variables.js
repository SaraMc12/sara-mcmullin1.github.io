// VARIABLES: 
//  a variable is a symbolic name or identifier that is associated with a value.
//  This value can vary, or change, during the execution of a program.
//  Variables are fundamental elements used for storing and manipulating data in a program.
// Variables can represent various types of data, such as numbers, text, boolean values (true/false),
//  or more complex data structures like arrays or objects. 
// They provide a way to label and reference data stored in the computer's memory.

// Name/ Decloration: Variables are identified by a name, which is used to refer to them in the code. 
// such as starting with a letter or underscore, and usually cannot contain spaces.
//  Variable declaration 
var age 

// Value: Variables store data values. These values can be assigned initially and changed during the program's execution.

var age = 35

// Reassignment: depending on which type of variable has been declared you can easily reassign CSSFontFeatureValuesRule
// unless you have declaired the value using Const
const age = 35
age = 45
 console.log(age) 
//  age will equal 35

var name = Val
name = Lexi

console.log(name)
// name will equal Lexi

let isStudent = true
isStudent = false

console.log(isStudent)
// isStudent will equal false
